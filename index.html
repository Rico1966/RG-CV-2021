      Almost one year after joining BGK (1 September 2014) I became Head of newly created Large Corporates Dept. which was a new organizational unit to be responsible for sales to corporations with yearly turnover exceeding PLN 1 billion. I built the team from scratch and I ran the unit for 5,5 years until 13 January 2021 when it was merged with another departament responsible for traditional BGK Clients such as ministries etc. For full 5 consecutive years (between 2015 and 2020) we were responsible for implementation of the sales budget. Our average annualized growth ratio for this period is higher than 20%.
